/** Design Note: Antidotes are meant to last as long as the poison, and purge them much quicker
 Having a 1 to 1 antidote to poison where you have to tailor defense to an increasing amount of attack
 is a bad idea, since that just means no one will use antidotes and the weapon win the race vs defense.
 This means pre ingesting antidote when expecting poison is a viable strategy.
 Previously, antidote did not have a dylovene-like effect and just purged toxin damage while poison will outlast them.

/* Buff potions
	Previously, it would apply a status effect to the mob lasting for 93 / 300 seconds and remove everything
	However it meant that putting it in an alchemical vial was a trap as it sipped 9 units instead of 5 units that is the required minimum.
	And removed any excessive potion inside the body. This has been changed to apply a 3 seconds buff to the mob, but have much lower
	metabolization rate, so that the duration of the buff depends on how long you last. 
	Roughly tested. At Metabolization Rate 1. 9 units sip (1/3 of a vial) last 20 seconds.
	To make this somewhat equal to the old system, base metabolization rate is 0.1 - making it last 200 seconds - 600 seconds if you sip an entire vial.
	This is 2x on weaker potions (Intelligence, Fortune). However, overdose threshold is now 30 units so you can only drink one vial at once.
	And potion stacking is not possible without neutralizing itself.

//Poisons
/* Tested this quite a bit. Heres the deal. Metabolism REAGENTS_SLOW_METABOLISM is 0.1 and needs to be that so poison isnt too fast working but
still is dangerous. Toxloss of 3 at metabolism 0.1 puts you in dying early stage then stops for reference of these values.
A dose of ingested potion is defined as 5u, projectile deliver at most 2u, you already do damage with projectile, a bolt can only feasible hold a tiny amount of poison, so much easier to deliver than ingested and so on.
If you want to expand on poisons theres tons of fun effects TG chemistry has that could be added, randomzied damage values for more unpredictable poison, add trait based resists instead of the clunky race check etc.*/
