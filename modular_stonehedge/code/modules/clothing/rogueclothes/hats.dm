//studded hood and shit brought to you by vide noir
//it requires sewing to make the padded hood and blacksmithing to make studded hood, like studded armor.
//this is an upgrade to leather helmet cause it's more bothersome and (there is literally no reason to have leather helmets cause there is no weight class for them anyway.)
//but this atleast hides your identity and looks cool, have more crit resist types.
